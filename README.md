# TicTacToe - Game Rules:
The traditional version of Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3Ã—3 grid that incorporates 9 squares. 
Players game starts (either X or O) and must play the entire game using the same mark.
Players take turns, making only 1 mark with each turn.
Marks can only be placed in empty squares, and once it is placed, it is permanent.
The winner is the first player to get 3 of their marks in a straight line (the line can be positioned diagonally, vertically, or horizontally).
The game is over when all 9 squares are filled with marks, even if none of the players have a straight line of 3 marks.
If neither player has a straight line of 3 marks, it is considered a tie.
